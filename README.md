## My Personal Pi-hole Lists ##
This repo contains the combination of blocklists, whitelists, and regular expressions I use to configure my Pi-hole servers:

- blocklists.txt - The blocklists I use to limit ads and tracking on my networks
- whitelists.txt - The whitelists I use to allow access to specific services
- regex.txt - The regular expressions I use to both block and allow traffic, based on patterns in their name (including wildcard domains)

Use at your own risk.
